<p>
    <b>Thor and Jordan first matched on Tinder in December 2014. </b>
Thor had just turned 22 a week prior, and Jordan was days 
away from her 24th birthday. Jordan had set the lower end 
of the age range to be just a year younger than her, so it was 
very unlikely that Thor would have shown up in her feed. They exchanged 
phone numbers after a few messages, shared music recommendations, and 
bonded over both living in Savannah during college. They planned to 
make plans after the holidays, but like many Tinder matches, they 
didn't end up meeting.
<br><br>
Fast forward to October 2020, the two match again! They both 
remembered each other and regretted not going out when they originally 
matched six years ago. Thor saw that Jordan's bio now said <i>PhD Student at Georgia Tech</i>
and he asked the innocent question <i>"What are you going to grad school for?"</i> 
Anyone who knew Jordan back then knew that she was miserable being a full-time 
student and any questions about her studies would cause her to shut down... so she 
didn't respond and Thor took it as a sign she was uninterested. <b>(Still don't ask Jordan how 
her PhD is going.) </b>
<br><br>
In February 2021, Jordan saw Thor on Bumble and knew she shouldn't fumble a third time. 
She swiped right once more hoping for a match. Thor was hanging out at Austin and Amberlyn's 
house when he got a notification from Bumble that someone had liked him. He opened 
the app and saw Jordan's picture, hoping she was his admirer. <b>Another right swipe and they 
were a match! </b>Jordan didn't want to lose her chance again and in her first message to Thor 
she asked if they could go on a date. The two had busy work weeks so they made plans for the 
next Saturday to go to Orpheus Brewery <i>(or Piedmont Park if Orpheus was too crowded.)</i> 
<br><br>
They ended up going to Piedmont Park for their date and Thor filled a cooler with all of Jordan's
favorite beers. They caught up on all that had happened since they first matched six years ago, 
ordered Zunzi's <i>(a Savannah favorite)</i> on Uber Eats, bonded over a love for American Apparel 
Fisherman Sweaters. Thor introduced Jordan to <i>I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson</i> so 
she would know all the references Thor makes. <b>They spent every weekend together after that date. </b> 
<br><br>
Thor and Jordan quickly knew they were meant to be together and made plans for Thor to move 
into Jordan's house near their first anniversary. In that first year, they met each other's family, 
traveled, and spent holidays together. Jordan decided that she would rather be a part-time PhD student 
and started teaching full-time at HIES. Thor was also unhappy at his job, and the two joked about what 
if he also got a job there. Sure enough there was an opening in IT, and he was perfect for the 
role. <b>They've been carpooling to work and getting lunch together from the school cafeteria ever since. </b>                                          
<br><br>
On December 17, 2022 (Jordan's birthday), Thor surprised Jordan with one more present to open, 
even though she had already received gifts. She reached inside the bag and there was a box 
containing a wooden doll that she had seen on their trip to Switzerland. <i>"It's me!"</i> she said 
just like she had when she saw the doll in the store. The next box had another doll, 
<i>"It's you!"</i> Strategically placed on the bottom was a third box, with a wooden cat. 
<i>"It's Mina!"</i> When  Jordan took it out of the box she saw a piece of yarn tied around
 the neck. <i>"Awww she has a collar!"</i>, she said before she noticed that a ring was tied 
 to the collar. <b>Thor asked Jordan to marry him, and she said yes.</b>
